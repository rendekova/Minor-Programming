                 <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming is a new challenge for me. I started programming just three months ago with no prior experience, but with great interest and passion. The beginnings were tough, but I feel like I am making progress now. The first website you see is built from scratch. It's a great feeling to see how the code comes alive!

            <h4>CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python</h4>
            <p>
                I started my programming journey with **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course from Harvard University**. It provided a robust foundation in computational thinking and problem-solving, covering topics from C to Python, SQL, and web development.

            </p>
            <p class="skilly">
                **Skills gained from CS50:** C, Python, SQL, basic Algorithms, HTML, CSS.

                    <h4>Pico Project - My First Microcontroller Experience</h4>
                    <p>
                        As part of my early learning, I explored the world of microcontrollers through a **Pico Project**. This hands-on experience taught me about embedded systems and how to bring code to life on physical hardware.
